cant use continus array if we want to remove somthing
use map to simulate linked list, since we know its in blocks
can not use linked list directly, because we need index access

Invent related problem:
given the frequent block updates, what is the data structre to answer a block is all dead or not? 
idea: will be similar to segment tree/interval tree. Although note that segment tree is generally static, but in our case, what is dead remains dead, so the over all update cost will be amortized to nlogn
