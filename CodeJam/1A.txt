first method:

if there is a decrease: the delta is # of eatan
if there is increase: could each nothing, with only put
i.e.

for each one, we check previous,
if less, the delta is eaten, otherwise, do nothing

second method
what is the min rate that she eats?
=> to be precise, how many she eats within 10 sec

if only increasing: 1 per sec
the slowest speed = max delta => otherwise she can't decrease as much!!

so find the largest delta => that is the MIN speed she eats, this delta >= 10
for each interval
if num < delta => eat += num
