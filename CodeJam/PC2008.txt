Diff B, Same W
(B, W) => (B, W - 1) 1W1B
(B, W-1) 2W
(B -2, W + 1) 2B

Notice if B is even, we can always finish off with a 2B => only whites left => only 1 white left
if B is odd, there is no way we can get rid of that final B, but the game will continue as long as # balls > 1 => so the final ball must be B

Cover N points with K squares, squares must be parallel to axis

Consider 1-d case, line with N points, cover it with K segements.

Insight: 
1. the line seg length must an integer. Otherwise, there must be some padding we can reduce. So we can bsearch on the line seg length, from L to R.

2. When we use a new seg, new seg starts with uncovered seg. Greedy proof

How much insight can we carry over to 2-D case? Both! so we just do bsearch on square length!

-----
Given complete graph G, and K forbidden edges, how many Hamiltanian paths can you form? n <=300, |K| <= 15

for small dataset a 9!/2 complete search would do

Hints:
1. caluclate f(s): number of cycles that uses at least all edges in s, s is a subset of K
2. when we are calcing f(s): how many ways to add an edge in s into the "known connected" part. How will this addition affect number of selections when we want to add the next edge in s into the connected part
3. what is the relationhship between f(s) and our answers
