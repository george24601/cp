A:
# of substrings with m consecutive non-vowels => nlogn max

for each index i
	if (i...i+m) is good
		return N-i+m
	else
		find next good block starts
		return N - start -3

trick. notice it doesnt matter which + or -, the parity will remain same. Since it is hard to break down into steps, we consider them together!
so we know
1+...N >= |x| + |y|
1+...N is same parity as |x| + |y|
proof: the condition is satisfied after each move, notice the first inequality case

assume |x| > |y|, when we remove the N part, the second part is always maintained, the first part
if (N <= |x|) => we move to x-N, x+N based on sign
if( N >= |x|, |x| >= |y|) => if x positive, move to x - N, if x negative, move to x + N
positive case:
N -x + |y| < N < 1 + N....1
negative case
N + x + |y| ...same argument

so for each (x,y) pair, we always deduce from the higher one
