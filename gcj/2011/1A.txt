FreeCell stats

Assume I won WD games today

D * PD = WD
G * PG = WG
D < N
G >= D
Note WG >= WD,i.e., G * PG >= D * PD

Consider when D < N < G, because we need only ONE solution, we will push G to limit
i.e., as long as N * PD > 1, we can extend G s.t., G * PG >= D * PD, i.e., 

Speicial case: PG = 0 or 100

So conditions: when PG = 0, PD must be 0
when PG = 100, PD must be 100
when PG in between: N * PD > 1 (can not be =)

The killer word
--------
insight: 
order of letters does matter, but we still need to keep track of occurance
wlgo, consider the order a-z

of course, at least step, we can not pick single na occurances, otherwise we are done!

---Consider small case

for each word, compute the the score if it is chosen

  for each letter in the seqence
    for each remaining word
        consistent with same pattern occurance, keep, and we know we need to keep guessing, 
        no longer consistent with that pattern, we need to score++, because we know we had to guess the last one! Also cross that one!

Assume first one is a hit
      

overall is 26 * n^2, too slow for large case, if only the look up could be faster...
