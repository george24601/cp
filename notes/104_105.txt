Condition:
if all neighbors are awakes, then this node is awake as well, i.e., we care only about connectivity. 
How to solve similar problems: 
1. graph traversal
2. union-find

So solve it differently:
1. similar to BFS, each round, check if all neighbors are awake, if so, then mark this as awake. We also keep track of if a node is on or not
2. each round, just union, if all its neighbors are active. At the end of each round, scan through all its roots to find the cluster size
