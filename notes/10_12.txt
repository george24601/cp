Once a member in a group is a suspect, all members in the group are suspects.
However, they find that it is not easy to identify all the suspects when a student is recognized as a suspect. Your job is to write a program which finds all the suspects.

Given two positive integers n and k, you should count the number of ways to express n as a sum of k different primes. Here, two ways are considered to be the same if they sum up the same set of the primes. For example, 8 can be expressed as 3 + 5 and 5 + 3 but they are not distinguished.

k<=14, n<=1120

arts writing a sequence of consecutive integers starting with 1 to N (1 < N < 10000) . After that, he counts the number of times each digit (0 to 9) appears in the sequence. For example, with N = 13 , the sequence is:

12345678910111213

In this sequence, 0 appears once, 1 appears 6 times, 2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 3 times, and each digit from 4 to 9 appears once. After playing for a while, Trung gets bored again. He now wants to write a program to do this for him. Your task is to help him with writing this program.

We are given a string s of two characters `a' and `b'. Let a group be a maximal consecutive substring of the same character. Any group g of s of length at least two can be removed (or popped) and a new string is constructed by concatenating the remaining left and right substrings of s. We repeat this process until either the string becomes the empty string or there is no more group of length at least two.
Given a string, write a program to decide whether the string can be turned into the empty string by some sequence of popping operations.
