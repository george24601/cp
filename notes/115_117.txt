easier problem:
all 0 grids: identity, v can be infinite
all 1 grids:
f(2, g) = all 0 grids

A related pattern:
similar to a lot of things in group theory/cycle finding, keep applying f, you get either identity or a cycle 

There are at most 2^9 possible choices, so we can find the answer quickly!
i.e, if there is a cycle, v can be infinite
otherwise, max i is # of f before entering cycle, in those cases, v = i
