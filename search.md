# Search 

1. If the target could appear in multiple places, search all possible places. The main benefit is that it may save you some very detailed case discussion. Conversely, if you find case discussion is too annoying, just see if you can complete search the candidate space

2. If the target needs to satify multiple conditions, chop the conditions into sets independent of each other, and solve one at a time. In the end, just take the intersection of all result sets

3. Relaxation, complete search on the proprty of unknowns and proceed from there. Often, you can prove that it is actually if and only if conditions, i.e., no further step required!
