last step must be of form 10*
insight:
smallest happy number must be of form abcd, where a <= b<=c <= d in a base
we can use this to precompute all digit combos that are happy in a base
and then brute force?
because if we swap, we will create same result but higer number

Or, we just brute force to get all happy nums in all bases with cache
then do a look up when we encounter the set, probably need to print out answer and re-read it first


--------

small input:
we can force visit each node noly once => we can wait instead of travelling
at each step, we need to know: position + current time to do acyclic DP graph

Notice that we will take at most O(n +m ) steps so final value < O(n+m)*Cycle

large input(!!!)
cant work with values any more!
Use B-F to update its states based on its neighbors. We know exactly which point of cycle we are at since we know the time.

------
Notice that we dont really care which cards we get, just if we have seen this card or not

Suppose I have m cards already
a new pack:
Pr(with 1 card) = (c-m 1) * (m n-1)/(C m)
Pr(wiht 2 chrd) = (c-m 2) * (m n-2)/(C m)

Ex(from m to C) = Pr(with 1 card) (1 + Ex(from m+1 to C)) +
Pr(with 2 card) (1 + Ex(from m+2 to C)) +.....
