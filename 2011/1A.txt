Assume I won WD games today

D * PD = WD
G * PG = WG
D < N
G >= D
Note WG >= WD,i.e., G * PG >= D * PD

Consider when D < N < G, because we need only ONE solution, we will push G to limit
i.e., as long as N * PD > 1, we can extend G s.t., G * PG >= D * PD, i.e., 

Speicial case: PG = 0 or 100

So conditions: when PG = 0, PD must be 0
when PG = 100, PD must be 100
when PG in between: N * PD > 1 (can not be =)

The killer word
--------
insight: 
order of letters doesnt matter, but we still need to keep track of occurance
wlgo, consider the order a-z

biggest(set) = max(biggest(a,with occurenace na times), biggest(no occurance in a))

of course, at least step, we can not pick single na occurances, otherwise we are done!

---Consier small case
as pre-computation, need to know how many times it appears for each letter

for each word, compute the the score if it is chosen

  for each letter
    if letter in word
      keep ones with same # of occurance
      done if only 1 left
    else
      score ++
      cross ones that has letter in word
      

overall is 26 * n^2, too slow for large case, if only the look up could be faster...
