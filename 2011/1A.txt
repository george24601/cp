Assume I won WD games today

D * PD = WD
G * PG = WG
D < N
G >= D
Note WG >= WD,i.e., G * PG >= D * PD

Consider when D < N < G, because we need only ONE solution, we will push G to limit
i.e., as long as N * PD > 1, we can extend G s.t., G * PG >= D * PD, i.e., 

Speicial case: PG = 0 or 100

So conditions: when PG = 0, PD must be 0
when PG = 100, PD must be 100
when PG in between: N * PD > 1 (can not be =)

The killer word
--------
insight: 
we just care the set of letters in each word

max negative point = index  - size of set

if there is only 1 choice of word, the game ends immediately

when we pick the first letter,
either char exists or not
if it exists, we put them into bucket 0, with score 0
if it does not, we have another bucket, with score 1

for each set, we know it is hit/miss pattern

claim: for two words, the moments we know they have different hit/miss patttern, we know they are different

i.e., we can build a tree of patterns, a suffix-like tree, with each score given, in then end, check score on all tree nodes. We know the
tree has at most 10k * 2 nodes, since each side has only 2 choices, and we can force the path compression, and total entries at each
level-index is only 10k, with 26 levels max
