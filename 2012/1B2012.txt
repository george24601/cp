C:
by piegonhole princple, based on the range of values and # subsets, we know at least 2 subsets will share same sum
Birthday paradox:
23 people in room. 23 choose 2 pairs. each pair has 1/365 change being same birthday.
So expected # of pairs with same bday  = 253 /365

Similar reasoning:
so we can generate t subsets, then (t choose 2) * 1/(max sum of t) should be close to 1
i.e., when t is 5 or 6

Deterministic approach:
