A:
If hit enter:
Ex(enter) = Pr(bad) * (n -m + n) + (1-Pr(bad)) * n
If back space
Ex(back at m) = Pr(m-1 good) * (1 + n -  m) + (1-Pr(m-1 good)) * (Ex(back at m -1)) 
If retype
Ex = m - 1

B

Greedy: sorted by <requirement, star inverse>

linear scan it, and keep track of which are done already to solve the case where level 2 has <= requirement than level 1

C
think all cars run in parallel
collision will happen iff when 2 cars meet, a thrid car is within that "block"

we can normalize the calculation by setting lowest speed to 0, lowest distance to 0

for each car i
	for each car j
		if( speed i < j && position i < j)
			continue
		calculate moment of collision
		
		for each car k
			if k within that block during moment of collsion
				update candidate
