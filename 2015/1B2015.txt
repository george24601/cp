10^14: need L

each step, either reverse digits or add 1, starting from 1
insight:

cant reverse twice in a row
i.e., a reverse must be followed by an inc

from data:

1 to 9: inc
19: 19
23: 12 rev 2

consider the last step:

make first digit  = last digit
reduce both to 0

or which one can reduce more? => 1 or reverse?
greedy: pick the best one: problem: # of steps desnt inc as val of number 

how to introduce a digit?
reverse doenst reduce the digits at all, only potentially dec
only add can introduce digit
so need to inc last digit to 9

so dec approach probably doesnt work well, because 1 to 0 then swap is NOT reversible1


so two stages:
1 buff to enought digits, because if not enough, we have to go 9+ and to introduce new digits anyway
2 digits manipulation

3 digits: 101 to make middle digiit, then swap to make first/last digit
4 digits: 1001: 
reduction can work => reduce to 1 0* 1

so need to form 1*01*
