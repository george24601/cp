1. consider a single row case

one problem is building ground up get us stuck => where to put next
then from top down => we know the max, then at each step, we should try to reduce as much as we can

consider a row case
reduce all 2 neighbors -> 1 neighbors -> 0 neighbor

Q: what is the max # one can fit with at most 1 neighbors?
border must be met anyway, so it becomes
1101101
11011011
110110101
11011011011 -> back to the beginning!
101010101 => no neighbor case, anthything between has only 1 index
