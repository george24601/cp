K <= 2 * 10^9 
V <= 1000

how many distince bland colors are there, WLOG, consider set in order, then we worry about permutation

1. bland color, all 3 different 
0 -> 1 => 0 choices
0 -> 2 => 1 choices
0 -> 3 => 2 choices 
...
0 -> v => v - 1 choices

for 0, it is (0 + v -1) * v / 2, same for all start <= k - v

when start >= k - v + 1

start -> start + 1 => 0 choices
start -> start + 2 => 1 choices
start -> k => k - start - 1 choices

this part is 
(0 + k - start - 1) * k - start / 2

for all start between k- v + 1 to start

-----
this sum * 6 for combination

2. bland color, 2 different
0 -> 1 to v
1 -> 2 to v + 1
....
k-v -> k -v + 1 to k 
-----this part v * (k-v + 1)
k - v + 1 -> k

k - v + 2 -> k
....
k - 1 -> k

---this part (k - 1 + k-v +1) * (v -1 ) /2

this sum * 2 (which one is dup) * 3 (choice to insert different one)

3. bland color all same
total = K + 1

n(low, high) = num of distince pairs of (a,b), where a < b, a >= low and b <= high

Power levels
--------
if we know a number has D digits (D < 100000), what is the highest number N s.t. F(9000, N) <= 10^(D-1)

speicial case: E >= N - 1 

1. can binary search the N, and calculate the log

--------
brute force keeping track of visited too huge

consider the case of only up and right
i.e., use turn right move only once
use turn right move 0  times => to top
only once => top right, but many different ways
find a nice bound recursive case: sprial-ish

never turn right => 1 possible choice
R1(r, c) = r //turn right at which row?

turn right twice
R2(r,c) = 
if first is turn right, then in this case total is 1, i..e, hit the end!
if first is go up, anything in r', c' is fair game, and only 1 way!
after that, it becomes R2(r-r' + 1, c' - 1), where r' from 2 to r, c' from 2 to c

when R or C = 1, there is only one way : go ahead till the end!
