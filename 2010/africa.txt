Odd Man Out
-------
a simple map<int, int> would do, find the one with count = 1


Get to Work
------
for each town other than T, start with larget P, until sum of Ps > # of employees at that town, otherwise impossible

Qualification Round
------
Analogy: put P items into C sets, s.t., sum of these sets are as close as possible

Solve a simpler analogous problem:
Consier C = 2 case. This is the partition-optimziation problem, which is NP-hard

Reduction of subset sum to partition:
-----
add Total+Target, 2*Total-target, as element of the original set

if there exists answer, then we can find two equal subsets

if we can find two equal subsets, then there exists an answer
-----

C> 2, then it becomes mult-way partition problem. This means the brute force reduction can not work!

small input: repeat the simple insight until unable to. 

However, proving it is hard.

Polygraph
------
General idea is to keep finding inconsistency and update fact until unable to do.

reduce the whole system into a linear equation, with mod marking true or false.
